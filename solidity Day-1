Blockchain:
  A blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that records and stores data across multiple computers (nodes) in a network.
  Each block in the blockchain contains a set of transactions, and these blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes, forming a chain of blocks.
  The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that no single entity has control over the entire network, making it more secure and resistant to censorship.
  The use of cryptographic algorithms ensures the integrity and immutability of the data stored in the blockchain.
  
Smartcontracts:
  Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions that automatically execute actions when specific conditions are met.
  Smart contracts are written in programming languages like Solidity and deployed on the blockchain.
  They facilitate trust and eliminate the need for intermediaries by automatically enforcing the agreed-upon terms of the contract.

Ethereum:
  Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform that enables the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications.
  Ethereum uses its native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) for transactions and as an incentive for miners who maintain the network.
  The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment where smart contracts are executed. 
  It ensures consistency across different nodes by enforcing the same rules and computations.
  Solidity is the most widely used programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.
  
Decentralized Applications (DApps):

DApps are applications that run on a blockchain network, leveraging its decentralized and secure nature.
DApps aim to eliminate intermediaries, increase transparency, and provide users with more control over their data and digital assets.
DApps often have front-end user interfaces like traditional applications but rely on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules, for their backend functionality.


Miners:
  Miners are specific types of nodes that participate in the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain. 
  In blockchain networks that use a proof-of-work consensus algorithm, miners compete to solve complex mathematical
  puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.

Nonce:
 Nonce stands for "number used once.
 Nonces are often used to introduce an element of randomness in cryptographic algorithms or protocols. 
 Ex:in key exchange protocols like Diffie-Hellman,nonces are used to generate random secret values that help ensure secure key generation and prevent replay attacks.

web1:
It is static/read-only,there is no interactivity.
web2:
It is read-write web,there is lot of interactivity
web3:
It is a decentralized web,semantic web.

NFT:
  NFT stands for "non-fungible token," which is a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content.
  Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to
  one basis, NFTs are distinct and cannot be exchanged on an equal basis.

Consensus Mechanisms:
  Consensus mechanisms are used to achieve agreement among the network participants on the state of the blockchain.
  Proof of Work (PoW) is a widely known consensus mechanism used by Ethereum, where participants (miners) compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate and add blocks to the blockchain.
  Ethereum is transitioning to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Ethereum 2.0, which relies on validators who hold and lock up Ether as collateral to secure the network.

Gas and Gas Fees:
  Gas is a unit of measurement on the Ethereum network that represents the computational effort required to execute transactions or smart contracts.
  Gas fees are the fees paid in Ether to incentivize miners or validators to include transactions or smart contracts in the blockchain.
  Gas fees are calculated based on the complexity and computational resources consumed by the transaction or smart contract.

Test Networks:
  Test networks are used for development, testing, and experimentation without incurring real costs or affecting the live blockchain.
  
Token Standards:
   Token standards define a set of rules and functionalities for creating and managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
   ERC-20 is the most widely adopted token standard, defining a common interface for fungible tokens, where each token is interchangeable with another of the same type.
   ERC-721 is a token standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), representing unique and indivisible digital assets such as collectibles, virtual land, or digital artwork.
  
Decentralized Finance (DeFi):
   DeFi refers to a collection of financial applications and protocols built on blockchain technology, primarily on Ethereum.
   DeFi aims to provide decentralized alternatives to traditional financial intermediaries, offering services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming.
   DeFi protocols often use smart contracts to automate and enforce financial transactions and agreements without the need for intermediaries.
   
ERC-20:
    ERC-20 is a widely adopted token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. 
    It defines a set of rules and standards that a token contract must follow to be considered ERC-20 compliant. 
    ERC-20 tokens are fungible, which means that each token is mutually interchangeable with any other token of the same type

Coins: 
Coins are native cryptocurrencies that operate on their own independent blockchain.
Examples of coins include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).
Coins typically serve as a form of digital currency and have their own network and blockchain infrastructure.

Tokens:
Tokens, on the other hand, are digital assets that are built on existing blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. 
Tokens are created and operate using smart contracts, which are programmable contracts on the blockchain.
Tokens can represent various things, including utility within a specific application, assets, or even ownership in a company.
  
 All coins are tokens,all tokens are not coins
