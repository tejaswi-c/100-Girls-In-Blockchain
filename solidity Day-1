Blockchain:
-it is a decentralized system
-it consists of blocks that are linked together.
-the blocks cannot be removed.

Smartcontracts:
-smart contracts are nothing but a code that run automatically when specific conditions are met

Miners:
Miners are specific types of nodes that participate in 
the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain. 
In blockchain networks that use a proof-of-work consensus 
algorithm, miners compete to solve complex mathematical
puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.

Nonce:
Nonce stands for "number used once.
-Nonces are often used to introduce an element of 
 randomness in cryptographic algorithms or protocols. 
-For example, in key exchange protocols like Diffie-Hellman, 
 nonces are used to generate random secret values that help 
 ensure secure key generation and prevent replay attacks.

web1:
It is static/read-only,there is no interactivity.
web2:
It is read-write web,there is lot of interactivity
web3:
It is a decentralized web,semantic web.

NFT:
NFT stands for "non-fungible token," which is a type
of digital asset that represents ownership or proof 
of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content.
Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, 
which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to
-one basis, NFTs are distinct and cannot be exchanged
on an equal basis.

DApps:
DApps, short for decentralized applications, are software applications built on top of blockchain platforms.
